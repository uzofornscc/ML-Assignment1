# Machine Learning Assignment 1: Comparing Two Classical ML Algorithms(20%)
### Objective
In this assignment, you will choose two classical machine learning algorithms implemented byscikit-learn, spend some time researching them, then describe each algorithm in your own words,compare and contrast their strengths and weaknesses, and apply both algorithms to the samedataset - of your choice.
Instructions

### Part 1: Algorithm Selection
1. Choose two classical machine learning algorithms
from the scikit-learn library. Some examples include:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
6. k-Means
7. Naive Bayes
8. Random Forest
   
### Part 2: Descriptions
2. Write a brief description of each algorithm:
Explain the main concepts behind the algorithm.
Discuss how the algorithm works in a straightforward manner.

### Part 3: Comparison
3. Compare and contrast the two algorithms:
Strengths
: What are the advantages of each algorithm?
Weaknesses
: What are the limitations or disadvantages of each algorithm?
Discuss the types of problems each algorithm is best suited for.

### Part 4: Application to a Dataset
4. Select a dataset (you can use datasets from anywhere. Check out
UCI Machine LearningRepository
or
Kaggle
):
Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing (cleaning, normalization,etc.).
Apply both algorithms to the dataset:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train each model and make predictions.
Perform some tests to evaluate model quality

### Part 5: Discussion of Results
5. Discuss the results of your experiments:
Compare the performance of the two models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy,precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE).
Reflect on the effectiveness of each algorithm based on the results. Which modelperformed better, and why do you think that is?
